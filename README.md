# Surface Area and Volume of 3D Shapes

## Description
This project demonstrates the concept of Polymorphism in Java by modeling various 3D shapes (Sphere, Cylinder, Cube) using a common interface "Shape3DInterface". The program calculates the surface area and volume of these shapes dynamically, showcasing how objects of different types can be treated uniformly via polymorphism.

### How Polymorphism Is Used
- The "Shape3DInterface" defines a common contract for all 3D shapes.
- Each shape (Sphere, Cylinder, Cube) implements the interface, providing specific implementations for surfaceArea() and volume().
- In the main program, a list of "Shape3DInterface" references is used to handle objects of different types (Sphere, Cylinder, Cube) uniformly. The correct method implementation is invoked based on the actual object type at runtime (dynamic method dispatch).
